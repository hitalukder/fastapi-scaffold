# Fastapi RAG pipeline scaffold

This is a FastAPI RAG pipeline scaffold designed to allow you to focus on building the application rather than worrying about the underlying structure. It provides a best-practice framework and guidelines.

The structure of the RAG Pipeline project is based on IBM Watsonx.ai.
